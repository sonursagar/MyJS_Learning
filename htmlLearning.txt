SOME OF THE IMPORTANT TAGS
1)  <head> is the start of the this 
2)  <meta> is used to display special symbols and characters from different languages correctly 
3)  <body> is the body of the html 
4)  <h> is the heading ; Eg <h1>
5)  <p> is used to add the text as Paragraph
6)  <strong> can be used to make the text bold
7)  <em> is used to make text italic
8)  <li>Item 1</li> csn be used to list
        <ol> use this before the list to add numbers to the list
        <ul>use this before the list to add bullets to the list
9)  <a> can be used to dd link ; but when adding link we have to give the reference link to where it has to redirect to Eg : <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sourabh-sagar/"> You can also connect with me on Linkedin</a>
        in the above one we can also "target" if we want the link to open in the new tab : Eg :  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 
10) <img> is used to add image ; Eg <img src="image link">
        in the image tag add "alt" ; alt is the text which displays if the image doesnt load. eg: <img src="" alt="there is a image here"
        also after the alt height and width can be added ; eg : <img src="{link}" alt="there is a image here" height="" width = ""
